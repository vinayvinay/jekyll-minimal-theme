A collection of my favourite technical quotes: witty, wise, or whacky, just keeping them all here in one place.

> Assignment: I Do Not Think It Means What You Think It Means.

> GOTO was evil because we asked, "how did I get to this point of execution?" Mutability leaves us with, "how did I get to this state?"
